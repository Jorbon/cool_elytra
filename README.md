# Cool Elytra Roll

This is a simple Minecraft mod that adds physics-based camera rotation while in flight. An optional mode adds a realistic control scheme that mimics an actual plane yoke to allow free rotation in all three axes.

The project is organized using [fabric-ralli](<https://github.com/Jorbon/fabric-ralli>), a compatibility testing utility created by me for easier update support.
